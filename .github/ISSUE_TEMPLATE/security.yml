        ## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Security Disclosure Policy

        **This template is for reporting security vulnerabilities in Oscura itself** (the software library).

        **This is NOT for:**
        - Hardware vulnerabilities discovered using Oscura (those are features!)
        - Protocol weaknesses found during reverse engineering
        - Security issues in systems you're analyzing

        If you've found a **critical security vulnerability**, please email the
        maintainers directly instead of creating a public issue.
